How do I assign tickets to a group?
----------------------------------

After you have [added groups](/adding-groups/) to your helpdesk and added users to groups,

1. Select tickets you want to assign in the listing and click 'Assign to Group'. You can also open a ticket and click 'Assign to Group'. 
2. From the list of groups, select the group you want to assign the ticket to
3. Click 'Assign'

The ticket would be assigned to the group and the assignment information changed in the ticket or listing.

How will group members know that a ticket has been assigned to them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

An email notification is sent to all members of the group when a ticket is to them.

Where can I access the tickets assigned to my Groups?
-----------------------------------------------------

You can access all the tickets that are assigned to you in the 'My Group Tickets' section in the left navigation bar.
