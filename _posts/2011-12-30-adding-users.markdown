How many users can I add to SupportBee?
---------------------------------------
There's no restriction on the number of users that you can add to your Helpdesk. In-fact, your billing has no bearing on the number of users added. We recommend that you add everyone in your team to SupportBee.


How do I add users to SupportBee?
---------------------------------
If you are an admin, you can add more users by following the steps below


1. Click on the Admin link in the top right corner of the main page after logging in.
2. Click the 'Users' tab
3. Click the 'Add a new user' button
4. Enter the email id of the user you want to add
5. Update the user details and Click on 'Add User'

When you click on 'Add user' we will send an invitation to the email id that you provided. Once the user accepts the invitation by clicking on the link provided in the mail, he/she will be able to access and reply to the support tickets.
