<p class="attention">Deleting a private repo will delete all forks of the repo.  Deleting a public repo will not.</p>

Go to the repository homepage &rarr; Admin:

![](/images/delete-repo-1.jpg)

At the bottom of the page there is a button to delete the repo:

![](/images/delete-repo-2.jpg)

Collaborators can not delete repos, but they can [leave them](/leave-a-repo).
