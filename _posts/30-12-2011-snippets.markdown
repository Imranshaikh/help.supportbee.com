How do I automatically send an acknowledgement for new tickets?
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can send an acknowledgement to your customers everytime they create a new ticket (via email or web). Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Click on Admin link in the top right corner of the screen
2. Select the Email Setup tab
3. Check the box labeled 'Auto respond to new tickets with an acknowledgement'
4. Enter the text that you would like to send in the email in the text box labeled 'Auto respond with this message'.
5. You can use some variables in the reply that will be replaced with the correct values when we send the email
    * \{\{FIRST_NAME\}\}
    * \{\{LAST_NAME\}\}
    * \{\{SUBJECT\}\}
    * \{\{EMAIL\}\}
