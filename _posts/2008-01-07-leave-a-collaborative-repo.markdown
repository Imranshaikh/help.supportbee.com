To leave a repository on which you are collaborating:

_Click "Account Settings"_ > _Click "Repositories"_

![](/images/remove_repo.png)

An "x" will show up in the corner of the repositories you can remove.

None of your commits will be lost. Only the repository owner can [delete repos](/deleting-a-repo/).
