What are snippets?
----------------------------------

When you have a reasonably large ticket volume, you will often be
repeating your work by answering the same questions. To avoid repitition, you can save your answer as a snippet which can be used in just a single click in your replies. 

Sinppets can also be used to save blocks of text within an answer that gets repeated. For example, if you have a standard intorduction and conclusion for all your replies you can save them as snippets to be used in all your replies.


Where do I add snippets?
-------------------------------

If you are an admin, you can add a snippet by following the steps below


1. Click on the Admin link in the top right corner of the main page after logging in.
2. Click on the ‘Snippets’ tab
3. Click on the ‘Add a new snippet’ button
4. Fill in the Name (used to identify the snippet in your reply), Content and Tag details
5. Click on ‘Add Snippet’


How do I use snippets in my replies?
---------------------------------------------------------

To add snippets to your replies, use the 'Search and insert snippets' option on the top
right corner of the reply box. You can either search for a snippet using
their names/tags or choose one from the drop down list.


Can I use multiple snippets in the same reply?
----------------------------------------------

Yes, you can.
