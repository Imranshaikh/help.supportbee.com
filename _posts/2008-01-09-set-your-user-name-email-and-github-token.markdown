<p class="intro">This guide covers basic git settings you should set before making any commits.</p>

<p class="intro">Please note that config changes will only affect future commits.  Existing commits will retain the info they were committed with.  Also, the environment variables <code>GIT_COMMITTER_NAME</code>, <code>GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL</code>, <code>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME</code> and <code>GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL</code> will override git-config settings if they are defined.</p>
