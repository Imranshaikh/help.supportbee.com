<span class="intro">If you&rsquo;ve found yourself on this page, we&rsquo;re assuming you&rsquo;re brand new to Git and GitHub. This guide will walk you through the basics and explain a little bit about how everything works along the way.</span>

##<span class="step">First:</span> Follow A Friend

One of the great features on GitHub is the ability to see what other people are working on and who they are connecting with. When you follow someone, you will get notifications on your dashboard about their GitHub activity.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><span class="step-title">Pick a friend.</span></p>

    <p>Why not follow one of these cool people?</p>
    <div class="founders">

    <p>Who are these fine fellows? We're the founders of GitHub, of course!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="step-title">Follow a friend</span>

    <p>Once you are on one of their pages, click the &ldquo;follow&rdquo; button.</p>

    <img src="/images/bootcamp/bootcamp_4_follow.jpg" width="558" height="151" alt="Click &ldquo;Follow"  />

    <p>Congratulations! You are now following a friend.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
##<span class="step">Next:</span> Watch A Project

At some point you may want to stay up-to-date with a specific project. We&rsquo;ve made this easy to do.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><span class="step-title">Watch a project</span></p>

    <p>Our friend the Octocat has a project called <a href="https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World" target="_blank">Hello World</a> that we&rsquo;d like to watch.</p>

    <p>Once you are in the project page, you will notice there is a &ldquo;watch&rdquo; button at the top of the page. Click on it.</p>

    <img src="/images/bootcamp/bootcamp_4_watch.jpg" width="558" height="151" alt="Click &ldquo;Watch" />
    <p>Congratulations! You are now watching the the Hello World project. If the Octocat updates it, you will see what happened in your dashboard.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

##<span class="step">Then:</span> More Things You Can Do

You&rsquo;ve done some of the most basic social interaction GitHub has to offer, but don&rsquo;t stop there! Check out these other social features:

- <span class="step-title">Pull Requests</span>

  <img src="/images/bootcamp/bootcamp_4_pull_requests.jpg" width="558" height="100" alt="Pull Requests" class="bootcamp top-margin"/>

  You may find yourself wanting to contribute to someone else&rsquo;s project, whether to add features or to fix bugs. After making changes, you can let the original author know about them by sending a [pull request](/pull-requests/).
  
- <span class="step-title">Issues</span>
  
  <img src="/images/bootcamp/bootcamp_4_issues.jpg" width="558" height="131" alt="Issues" class="bootcamp top-margin"/>

  When you are collaborating on a project with someone, you some times come across problems that need to be fixed. To help you keep track of these problems, each GitHub repo has a section called Issues. For an example, check out the [issues](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues) for the Spoon-Knife repo.
  
- <span class="step-title">Organizations</span>

  <img src="/images/bootcamp/bootcamp_4_org.jpg" width="558" height="200" alt="Organizations" class="bootcamp top-margin"/>
  
  Have you found yourself wishing you could collaborate with multiple developers on one project? You can manage everyone with Organizations! With an organization you can establish teams with special permissions, have a public organization profile, and keep track of activity within the organization.

##<span class="step">Lastly:</span> Celebrate

Congratulations! You are quite the socialite. What do you want to do next?
