What are the different company settings?
----------------------------------------

There are two company settings right now. You can update them at Admin > Company Settings

*   **Company Name** is the name shown in the header when you login to the Help Desk. It is also the [name used in your outgoing replies]({{ BASE_PATH }}/setting-up-sender-name).
*   **Primary Support Email Address** is used as 'From' address in [replies to web tickets]({{ BASE_PATH }}/address-in-replies/).
