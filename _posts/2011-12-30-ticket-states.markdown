Unanswered - Answered 
---------------------

Unlike traditional [email ticketing systems](/features/email), tickets in SupportBee have only two states - Answered & Unanswered. Also, they can be Unassigned or Assigned to a user or a group.

When a ticket is created, it is unassigned and unanswered (unless you have a [filter]({{ BASE_PATH }}/working-with-filters) that assigns it). When you reply to a ticket, it is marked Answered and it is moved to the Answered section. It stays in the 'Answered' section until you Archive it. Also, if the customer replies back, it is marked as Unanswered again so you can quickly see that it has a with new customer replies.

Archived
--------

You should 'Archive' a ticket if you think that you are done with it. Archive is like closed without the side effects (like having to re-open etc). We also record the time it took you to archive the ticket and give you a report on the average time to archive.

You can see all your Archived tickets by visiting 'All Tickets' and filtering by selecting 'Archived' in the state dropdown.
