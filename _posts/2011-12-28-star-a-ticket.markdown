What happens when I star a ticket?
----------------------------------

Two things happen when you star a ticekt

1. Once you star a ticket, it will stay in the Starred section of the 'My Tickets' screen. You can then keep a track of it.
2. If there is a new customer reply for a starred ticket, you get an email notification. However, you can [change your notification preferences](/notification-settings/).


Why do I need to star a ticket?
-------------------------------

There are few situations where you may want to star a ticket

1. Once you reply to a ticket, it disappears off the Unanswered section. If you still want to follow it up, you can star it.
2. If you [assign a ticket](/assigning-a-ticket) to someone else but still want to follow it up, you should star it
