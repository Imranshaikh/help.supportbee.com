What happens when I star a ticket?
----------------------------------

Two things happen when you star a ticekt

1. Once you star a ticket, it will stay in the Starred section of the 'My Tickets' screen. You can then keep a track of it.
2. If there is a new customer reply for a starred ticket, you get an email notification. However, you can [change your notification preferences]({{ BASE_PATH }}/notification-settings/).


When should I star a ticket?
-------------------------------

There are few situations where you may want to star a ticket

1. Once you reply to a ticket, it disappears off the Unanswered section. If you still want to follow it up, you can star it.
2. If you [assign a ticket]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assigning-a-ticket) to someone else but still want to follow it up, you should star it

If I star a ticket, is it starred for everybody else too?
---------------------------------------------------------

No, starring is a personal option. A ticket starred by you remains starred only for you  and shows up in your 'My Tickets' section.
