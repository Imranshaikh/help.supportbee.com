How do I reply to a ticket?
---------------------------

When you open a ticket and scroll down, you will see a text box for replying to tickets. You can also press 'r' after opening a ticket and the cursor will be put in the reply box for you to reply.

How can we make sure, two of us don't reply to the same ticket?
---------------------------------------------------------------

When you access a ticket which is already opened by another user, you will see a red alert in the bottom right corner of the ticket page that somebody else is also viewing it. This is a cue for you to move on to the next ticket because it is already being taken care of.


A ticket that I replied to disappeared off the listing. Where did it go?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you reply to a ticket, it will automatically go off the unanswered section for you to focus your attention on the rest. In SupportBee, there is no need for you to explicitly close a ticket. As you reply, the list shrinks and just burns the inbox. If you need to access a ticket in-spite of having replied to it, you can find it in the 'All Tickets' section (in the left navigation menu). Or you can [star it]({{ BASE_PATH }}/star-a-ticket) before you go back to the list to reply to the other tickets.

Where can I access all the answered tickets?
--------------------------------------------

There is no separate section to access just the answered tickets. However, you can access all the tickets that have ever come into the system from the 'All Tickets' section. The answered/archived tickets have a blue background differentiating them from unanswered tickets.

What if a ticket does not need a reply?
---------------------------------------

There are two cases when you don't need to reply to a ticket

1. The ticket is spam, in which case you can just mark it as spam.
2. It is a customer reply or a thank you ticket or a duplicate ticket that you don't want to reply to. In this case, you can [Archive]({{ BASE_PATH }}/archiving-a-ticket) it
