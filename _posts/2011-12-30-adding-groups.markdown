How do I add different groups/departments to SupportBee
-------------------------------------------------------

The permission to create departments in your helpdesk is restricted to admins. If you are an admin,  here’s how you can do it

1. Click on the Admin link in the top right corner of the main page after logging in.
2. Choose the ‘Groups’ tab
3. Click on ‘Add a new group’
4. Type the name of the group or the department (Eg: Sales, L1 Support...)
5. Click on ‘Add Group’

To add users to groups, you will have to edit users. You can learn more here. Please note that until you add users to your newly created group, it won't show up in the list of groups when you try to assign a ticket to a group.
