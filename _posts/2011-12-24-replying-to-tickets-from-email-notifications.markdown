Can I reply to tickets from Email notifications?
---------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can. Not just that, you can even reply inline! 

Is there way to avoid multiple agents replying to the same email notification?                 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Currently we don't have a feature to avoid this. We strongly
encourage you to use the web app if you have multiple agents working on
the same set of tickets. In the web app, we alert you when more than one
agent accesses a ticket.


If I reply to a ticket from the notification, is it marked answered in the web app?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Tickets are moved to the answered section once you reply to them
whether from the email notifications or from within the web app.
