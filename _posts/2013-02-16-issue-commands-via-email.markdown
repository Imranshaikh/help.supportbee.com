What can I do via email?
------------------------

You can star, assign, archive and do anything else you are used to doing via our web interface (a complete list of commands follows). You can do all of them simply by cc'ing to the right email address when replying to the ticket email you have received. For example if you want to star a ticket just cc star@supbee.com in your reply email and it will be starred.

List of commands
----------------

Issuing a command is super easy. While replying to your ticket email just cc the right @supbee.com email. You can cc

* Star a ticket: CC star@supbee.com
* Unstar a ticket: CC unstar@supbee.com
* Assign yourself to the ticket: CC assign.me@supbee.com
* Assign another user to the ticket: CC assign.name@supbee.com . You can just use the first name of the user (assign.prateek@supbee.com) or use the full name. If you want to use the full name you can do it this way: assign.Firstname.Lastname@supbee.com (eg. assign.prateek.dayal@supbee.com).
* Archive the ticket: CC archive@supbee.com
* Trash the ticket: CC trash@supbee.com , if you trash the ticket a reply will not be send.
* Mark the ticket as spam: CC spam@supbee.com, if you mark it as spam a reply will not be send
* Do not send the reply to the user: CC noreply@supbee.com. While a reply is not send if your reply is empty, using this command a reply will not be send no matter of the content of the email.

What about comments?
--------------------

You can comment on your ticket as well. Doing so is very simple, just add your comment inside the square brackets (these: []) in the ### area of your reply. The ### area is in the quoted part of your reply.

Will my ?client? see any of these?
----------------------------------

Of course not, both comments and commands will *never* and in no way be included in your ticket response. The user will only receive your reply to his ticket. If there is no reply in your message but only commands and/or a comment a response will not be sent.

What if I only want to issue a command and not reply to the ticket?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, if your email does not have a response, your user will not receive an empty email. You can just assign the ticket with a cc'ed command to someone else and go on with your work.
Notice: In case your email client includes a signature to your email, and your email only has a signature, we will still treat your reply as if it was empty.
