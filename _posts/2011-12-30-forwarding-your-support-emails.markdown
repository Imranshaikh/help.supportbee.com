How do I forward my support emails to SupportBee?

Here's how you can do it:

1. Visit Admin > Email Setup. Click 'Generate a New Forwarding Address'.  
2. Fill in the email address that you want to forward emails from and the name that you want your customers to see in the replies. Copy the forwarding address.
2. Follow the instructions at [http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957](http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957) and use the forwarding address that you copied above.
3. Open your SupportBee account and find the forwarding confirmation message from Gmail in the tickets page.
4. Click the verification link in that message.
5. Go back to your Gmail account and finish the instructions at [http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957](http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957).


Can I forward emails from more than one email inbox?

You can generate a new forwarding address for each email address that you want to forward to SupportBee.
