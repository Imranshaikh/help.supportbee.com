How do I forward my support emails to SupportBee?
-------------------------------------------------

To forward your emails to SupportBee, you need to create a forwarding address in SupportBee and then setup forwarding to this newly created address

### Creating a New Forwarding Address

A forwarding address helps us identify your emails when they arrive in SupportBee

1. Visit Admin > Email Setup. Click 'Generate a New Forwarding Address'.  
2. Fill in the email address that you want to forward emails from and the name that you want your customers to see in the replies. Copy the forwarding address.
3. You need to forward your emails to this address. The exact steps depend on your email providers. Please see the sections below


### Google Apps

1. Follow the instructions at [http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957](http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957) and use the forwarding address that you copied above.
2. Open your SupportBee and find the forwarding confirmation ticket from Gmail in the tickets page.
3. Click the verification link in that message.
4. **This Step is extremely important. The forwarding won't work without this**. Go back to your Gmail account and finish the instructions at [http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957](http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957).

Can I forward emails from more than one email inbox?
