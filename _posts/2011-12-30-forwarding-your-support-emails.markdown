How do I forward my support emails to SupportBee?
-------------------------------------------------

If you are using Google Apps for support (or any provider that supports email forwarding),  you can forward all your incoming support emails to your SupportBee account.  

Here's how you can do it:

1. Visit Admin > Email Setup. Click 'Generate a New Forwarding Address'.  
2. Fill in the email address that you want to forward emails from and the name that you want your customers to see in the replies. Copy the forwarding address.
3. You need to forward your emails to this address. The exact steps depend on your email providers


Here are the steps for Google Apps (one of the most popular email provider for businesses)

1. Follow the instructions at [http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957](http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957) and use the forwarding address that you copied above.
2. Open your SupportBee and find the forwarding confirmation ticket from Gmail in the tickets page.
3. Click the verification link in that message.
4. **This Step is extremely important. The forwarding won't work without this**. Go back to your Gmail account and finish the instructions at [http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957](http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=10957). 


Can I forward emails from more than one email inbox?
----------------------------------------------------

You can generate a new forwarding address for each email address that you want to forward to SupportBee. 

Can I automatically assign tickets to agents/group based on the email? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! You can automatically assign tickets to agents/groups or add labels (or both) based on the email address, body, subject etc using filters. Please see [Working With Filters](https://supportbee.com/help/working-with-filters/) for more help.

When I reply from SupportBee, what name shows up as sender's?
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can find out the name association with the email address in Admin > Email Setup
