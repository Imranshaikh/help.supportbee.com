How do I add CC in my replies to my support emails?
---------------------------------------------------

When you open a ticket, right on top of the 'New Reply' section you will see an add CC button. Click on it to add the email address that you want to CC.

Can I add multiple addresses in my CC?
---------------------------------------

Yes. Please, make sure you add them one by one by clicking on the Add CC button each time you want to add a new address.

Can I CC people that are not added as agents in the system?
----------------------------------------------------------

Sure! You can add anybody in the CC. For people that are already added as agents in the system, you will have the convenience of auto-completion for their email addresses.
